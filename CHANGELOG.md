# Changelog

All notable changes to the Sprint Capacity Planner are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-20

- Set the app vendor/author to **Nikita Koval** (was a placeholder).
- Trimmed the README to a concise project page; moved development/testing notes to
  `AGENTS.md` (with `CLAUDE.md` as a symlink to it).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-19

First tagged release. Ships the app package (`dist/sprint-capacity-planner.zip`), the
drag-and-drop planning board, part-time allocations, and the two demo reels (install &
walkthrough) recorded against a real YouTrack in Docker.


### Drag-and-drop planning board + configurable backlog

- **Planning board with a backlog.** The planner's "Plan work" section is now a drag-and-drop
  board: a **Backlog** lane (a configurable YouTrack search — new `ProjectConfig.backlogQuery`),
  an **Unassigned · in sprint** lane, and one **timeline lane per teammate** sized to their
  available capacity. Drag a backlog card onto a teammate to pull it into the Sprint *and*
  assign it in one move; drag onto Unassigned to add it without an owner; drag back to the
  backlog to remove it. New backend: `GET /sprints/:id/backlog`, `POST /sprints/:id/issues/:issueId/plan`,
  client `searchIssues` / `addIssueToSprint` / `removeIssueFromSprint`, and `Issue.Update`
  scope. Covered by `tests/contract/planning.test.ts`.
- **Over-capacity highlighting.** A Sprint-level bar flags when total committed work
  (including still-unassigned issues) exceeds planned capacity — even when no single person
  is over — and each lane turns red when that person is over their available days. The
  capacity table gains a per-person **Remaining** column.
- **Part-time allocations.** `Participant.allocation` (1 = full-time) scales a person's
  default capacity; set per teammate in settings.
- **Reach the planner from more places.** Added `ISSUE_OPTIONS_MENU_ITEM` (open the planner
  from a board card / issue) and `DASHBOARD_WIDGET` entry points (both validated on 2025.3),
  alongside the existing project-settings tab. (YouTrack exposes no board/sprint extension
  point, so the native sprint-edit dialog can't be replaced — a platform limitation.)

### Settings overhaul

- **Native pickers + clearer config.** Add teammates with a **user picker** (not a raw id);
  pick the Original/Current **effort fields from the project's custom fields** (not free
  text); the "Sprint length (days)" label no longer wraps.
- **Simpler focus factor.** Removed `firstSprintStart` (a new team's first Sprint starts
  today), `bootstrapFocusFactor`/`minFocusFactor`/`maxFocusFactor`/`maxFactorStep`. New
  Sprints start at a fixed **0.75** and calibrate by `learningRate` alone
  (`next = prev + α·(observed − prev)`, clamped to 0–1); a manager can override per Sprint.
  The algorithm is now explained inline in settings.

### Naming

- **Dropped the "real" qualifier** now that the only demo *is* real: `tests/e2e/real-demo` →
  `tests/e2e/demo`, `tests/real-youtrack` → `tests/youtrack`, the `*-real-youtrack.mjs` /
  `provision-real-demo.mjs` scripts and `demo:real*` / `*:real-youtrack` / `test:integration:real`
  npm scripts renamed to drop "real", reel titles/paths de-qualified.

### Single tab, new icon, demos

- **One "Sprint Capacity" tab.** The app now exposes a single project widget instead of two
  (planner + separate settings). Managers configure the app in-place via a **Settings**
  button that swaps the planner for the configuration form (with a "Back to planner"
  control); a manager-only **Configure** action also appears on the empty state before the
  app is set up. The stand-alone `project-settings` widget entry point was removed
  (`SettingsForm` is now embedded in the planner).
- **New app icon.** Replaced the plain three-bar mark with an indigo capacity-gauge badge
  (light + dark variants).
- **Removed all non-real demos.** The mock demo suite (`tests/e2e/demo`), its in-memory
  harness (`tests/e2e/harness`, `scripts/serve-demo.mjs`, `playwright.demo.config.ts`) and
  the mock-only npm scripts (`demo:serve`, `test:e2e:demo`, `demo:reels`,
  `test:e2e:analyze`) are gone. Only the YouTrack demo suite remains. The generic
  recording helpers moved to `tests/e2e/shared` (`cursor.ts`, `recording.ts`).

### YouTrack demos + integration

- **Demos now run against a YouTrack.** New `tests/e2e/demo` suite drives the app
  installed inside a live YouTrack (Docker 2025.3) — the actual app widgets (in their
  iframe) and the **native YouTrack Kanban board** — and records four narrated 720p reels
  (walkthrough, team capacity, configuration, native board). `npm run demo`
  provisions the instance, records, renders, and QAs via the demo-video-review skill (all
  reels ✅ APPROVE).
- **Removed the custom board stub.** The hand-built `boardStubHtml` / `/agiles` mock board
  is gone; the native board is shown only from the instance.
- **The app now actually runs inside YouTrack.** Fixed the Apps-SDK integration that
  was previously stubbed: HTTP handler discovery + shape, module load (no Node globals),
  the `@jetbrains/youtrack-scripting-api/http` transport, extension-property persistence
  (via `AppGlobalStorage`), group-membership lookup, a configurable managers group, and a
  first-run config bootstrap. Provisioning/seeding scripts:
  `provision-youtrack.mjs` (boots 2024.1 standalone on arm64; 2025.3 via Docker),
  `install-app-youtrack.mjs`, `setup-youtrack-demo.mjs`, `provision-demo.mjs`.


### Added (Jira-aligned planning)

- **Carry over unfinished work.** Create-next now matches Jira's Complete-Sprint step: the dialog names the exact count of unresolved issues in the latest Sprint and moves them into the new Sprint when opted in. `SprintView.unresolvedIssueCount` and `SprintSummary.unresolvedIssueCount` surface the count (persisted as `scpUnresolvedIssueCount`); the count in the dialog is always derived from the **latest** managed Sprint (the one being completed), not whichever Sprint is being viewed. Covered by unit + contract tests and the create-next / product-walkthrough demos.
- **Capacity-vs-committed indicators.** The capacity table gains a **Load (committed / capacity)** bar per person — committed Original Effort vs that person's available days, turning red with "⚠ over" when over-committed — and the capacity summary gains a **"what fits"** banner comparing committed Original Effort against planned capacity for the whole Sprint. New pure helper `committedFitMinutes` (unit-tested), asserted by the `09-assignment` demo.
- **Jira alignment documented.** `docs/JIRA_ALIGNMENT.md` maps our concepts and workflow onto Jira's (Original Effort ↔ "committed" estimate, Current Effort ↔ remaining, learned Focus Factor + Planned Capacity ↔ velocity/capacity, carry-over ↔ Complete Sprint) and records the adjustments made for terminology parity.
- **Demos cover the new work.** The flagship product-walkthrough reel now showcases the per-person **Load** bars and the **"what fits"** banner (over-committed → carry over → the next Sprint fits) alongside the carry-over step, and the per-person planning journey (`09-assignment`) is promoted to a **fifth voiced marketing reel** (`05-per-person-planning`) with title card + captions + narration — bringing the reel set to five.

### Changed (simplification)

- **Removed capacity confirmation entirely** — it was a redundant extra step. Gone from the model (`CapacityRow.confirmed`), the API (confirm/unconfirm endpoints, `confirmedCapacityMinutes`), the capacity table (Confirmed column) and summary (Participants-confirmed / Confirmed-capacity). The availability reminder workflow now nudges people who haven't *set* their availability instead.
- **No manual Refresh** — the project tab auto-refreshes (polls) so metrics stay live as issues change; the Refresh button is gone.
- **No manual Recalculate** — `GET /sprints/:id` now computes all metrics live from the current issue set, so reads are always current; the Recalculate button is gone (reconciliation still runs on mutations + on schedule to keep the cache warm).

### Added (demos)

- **Kanban board** — the board view is now a Kanban with **sprints enabled** (one swimlane per Sprint, To Do / In Progress / Done columns, issue cards); the sprint-navigation demo asserts it.
- **Title cards** — each marketing reel opens with a branded title card so the video introduces itself.
- **Voiceover** — `scripts/render-reels.mjs` synthesizes timed narration from each reel's WebVTT (macOS `say`) and muxes it onto the video as an H.264 `.mp4` under `artifacts/demo/reels/` (baked captions + narration). Degrades gracefully where TTS/ffmpeg are absent.

### Added (per-assignee planning)

- **Assign tasks to people while planning, with an Unassigned bucket.** Effort now rolls up per assignee (the issue's Assignee) as well as in total. The capacity table shows each person's **Assigned** load (with an over-capacity ⚠ when it exceeds their available days), and the effort summary shows the **Unassigned** remainder — so you can balance the team while leaving work owned by project direction rather than forced onto a person. Assigned load updates automatically as issues change. New `assigneeId` on issues; `aggregateEffort` returns `byAssignee` + `unassigned`; `SprintView` gains `assignedEffort` + `unassignedEffort`. Covered by unit + contract tests and the `09-assignment` demo.

### Added (marketing)

- **Two more marketing reels:** `00c-team-configuration-reel` (board / effort fields / schedule / naming / team / save) and `00d-installation-reel` (install from one ZIP → attach → open settings, over a simulated YouTrack install screen). Both cursored + subtitled (WebVTT), bringing the reel set to four.

### Fixed

- **Completed-effort window was ~24h short (audit).** The "resolved within the Sprint" upper bound used midnight of the finish day, so work closed on the last Sprint day was excluded from Completed Original Effort — understating Observed Focus Factor and mis-calibrating the next Sprint. Now inclusive of the whole finish day (`endOfDayUtcMs`), with unit + contract tests.
- **Capacity reset / confirm / unconfirm now enforce optimistic concurrency (audit).** They previously bypassed the revision check (last-write-wins); they now require `expectedRevision` and return `409` on a stale revision, like `PATCH capacity`.
- **`PUT /config` returned only `{ configRevision }`** but the widget expects a full `ConfigResponse`; it set the live config to `undefined` and the settings form never showed "Settings saved." Now returns the full response (caught by the team-configuration reel).

### Changed

- **Everyone is planned at 100% — per-person allocation removed** from the config, capacity rows, schemas, domain, and UI (settings team table + capacity table). Default capacity is `workingDays × hoursPerDay × 60`.
- **Capacity table simplified** — removed the Allocation, "Updated by", and Reset columns; Default and Available now render as plain day numbers (floats) rather than periods.
- **New "Remaining capacity" metric** (`Planned Capacity − Current Effort`) shown in the capacity summary; it updates automatically as issues are added/estimated/resolved.
- **Sprint deep-linking** — the project tab accepts `?sprint=<id>` to preselect a Sprint.

### Added

- **Two marketing reels, recorded like a human** — `00-product-walkthrough` (full story) and `00b-team-capacity-reel` (whole-team availability + confirmation). Both feature a visible gliding **cursor**, human pacing, crisp **720p**, on-screen **subtitles** plus a **WebVTT** track (`artifacts/demo/subtitles/*.vtt`), and a launch **blog post** ([`docs/blog/announcing-sprint-capacity-planner.md`](docs/blog/announcing-sprint-capacity-planner.md)).
- **Running the tests produces the demos** — `npm run test:all` (and `npm test`) now build the widgets, record all demo journeys (video/trace/subtitles), and write `artifacts/demo/ui-analysis.md` with an APPROVE/FIX-REQUIRED verdict. A dedicated CI `demos` job uploads the reels + subtitles.
- **Comprehensive product walkthrough demo** ([`tests/e2e/demo/00-product-walkthrough.spec.ts`](tests/e2e/demo/00-product-walkthrough.spec.ts)) — the end-to-end "sales reel" recorded as one video: overview → create next Sprint → member confirms availability → task added → remaining capacity updates automatically → open board.
- **Team-workflow demo** (create → set availability → confirm across Alice/Bob/manager), **auto-remaining-capacity demo** (adding a task lowers remaining capacity with no manual action), and **sprint-navigation demo** (switch Sprints via the selector; open the board to see issues and jump into a Sprint). Board stub + `/__demo` hooks live in [`tests/e2e/harness`](tests/e2e/harness).
- **Deterministic demo suite** — an auto-fixture resets the in-memory world (`/__demo/reset`) before every test, so the 9-journey suite is independent of run order and needs no AI to run: `npm run test:e2e:demo`.
- **Self-contained demo E2E suite** ([`tests/e2e/demo`](tests/e2e/demo), [`playwright.demo.config.ts`](playwright.demo.config.ts)) — drives the **real** widget bundles against the **real** backend wired to an in-memory YouTrack (served by [`scripts/serve-demo.mjs`](scripts/serve-demo.mjs) / [`tests/e2e/harness`](tests/e2e/harness)). Runs on any platform with no live YouTrack, records video/trace/screenshots per journey, and asserts structural accessibility (axe). Verdict from the analyzer: **APPROVE** (5/5 journeys, all videos pass integrity). Commands: `npm run test:e2e:demo`, `ANALYZE_BASE=artifacts/demo npm run test:e2e:analyze`.
- **`SprintSummary.sequence`** — surfaced in `GET /sprints` so the "Create next Sprint" preview derives from the latest managed Sprint.

### Fixed

- **Capacity/focus-factor/calibration mutations returned the wrong shape** — they returned `{capacity, capacityRevision}` / `{override}` / `{excludedFromCalibration}`, but the api-client and widgets expect a full `SprintView`, crashing the UI after any capacity edit or override. These endpoints now reconcile and return the updated `SprintView` (so metrics also refresh live). Verified by the demo E2E suite.
- **Sprint name template placeholders** — the settings default and the create-next preview used `{n}`, which the backend renderer does not understand; aligned to the real `{year}`/`{sequence}`/`{startDate}`/`{finishDate}` placeholders.
- **Create-next preview** now derives from the latest managed Sprint (max sequence) instead of the currently-selected one, matching the backend.
- **`scpLastRecalculatedBy`** is now persisted during reconciliation.
- **Validation errors** now return `400 VALIDATION_FAILED` (were `500`).

### Platform notes

- **Real-YouTrack integration on Apple-Silicon macOS is not supported** by the standalone (no-Docker) build: YouTrack 2025.1 bundles GraalVM/Truffle 22.0.0.2, whose JS scripting engine cannot initialise on arm64 (verified on JDK 8/11/17/21/25 and the bundled JRE under Rosetta — all crash on `sun.misc.Unsafe.ensureClassInitialized`). The headless provisioning + wizard bootstrap in [`scripts/provision-youtrack.mjs`](scripts/provision-youtrack.mjs) is fully implemented and verified up to that point; run real integration on Linux x64 (CI). The demo E2E suite covers the plugin UI end-to-end everywhere.

### Known SPIKE follow-ups

These integration points are isolated behind `// SPIKE` markers and must be verified/wired against a YouTrack instance:

- **SDK extension-property read/write wiring** — `getExtensionProperties` / `setExtensionProperties` in [`src/backend/repositories/youtrack-http-client.ts`](src/backend/repositories/youtrack-http-client.ts) are stubs (reads return `null`, writes no-op); the workflow accessors in [`src/workflows/workflow-common.js`](src/workflows/workflow-common.js) assume `entity.extensionProperties[name]`.
- **Board-permission check** — `canManageBoard` is a placeholder ("board is readable"); the real sprint create/update permission query is unverified.
- **Host bridge** — the widget↔host API in [`src/widgets/api-client.ts`](src/widgets/api-client.ts) (`YTApp.register`, `host.fetchApp`, project/user id sources, app base path).
- **YouTrack distribution URL** — pinned build, download URL, and launch flags in [`scripts/provision-youtrack.mjs`](scripts/provision-youtrack.mjs).
- **Real E2E selectors** — the live-YouTrack specs under [`tests/e2e`](tests/e2e) (excluding [`tests/e2e/demo`](tests/e2e/demo), which uses verified selectors) use placeholder selectors pending a live UI.

Additional unfinished wiring: no API route sets the `scpCapacityManagers` group yet; `reconciliationCron` in [`settings.json`](settings.json) is defined but the reconciliation workflow hardcodes its cron; `scpConfigVersion` is declared but unused (config version lives inside the JSON).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Pure domain library** ([`src/domain`](src/domain)) — capacity, effort, focus-factor calibration, calendar/working-day dates, Sprint naming/sequencing, permission decisions, and a sequential/idempotent migration framework + registry. Unit-tested with a ≥95% coverage gate.
- **Shared contracts** ([`src/shared`](src/shared)) — TypeScript types, zod schemas for every persisted JSON document, the HTTP API contract, request-body schemas, and the minutes/UTC unit policy.
- **Backend API** ([`src/backend`](src/backend)) — a transport-agnostic router + full route surface (config, boards, sprints, capacity, focus-factor/calibration, recalculate, diagnostics, export/import) with server-side authorization, zod validation, optimistic concurrency (`expectedRevision` → 409), a structured error envelope with correlation ids, sanitized logging, authoritative reconciliation, and the idempotent create-next-Sprint flow. Backed by the `YouTrackClient` transport boundary.
- **Contract tests** ([`tests/contract`](tests/contract)) — every backend service exercised against an in-memory fake transport with round-tripping extension properties and fault injection.
- **Workflows** ([`src/workflows`](src/workflows)) — six modules (issue-metrics, sprint-membership, issue-removal, completed-sprint, scheduled reconciliation, availability reminder) performing snapshot-based incremental updates that never block issue edits.
- **Ring UI widgets** ([`src/widgets`](src/widgets)) — the Sprint Capacity project tab and the Sprint Capacity Settings form, with a typed API client and isolated host bridge.
- **Build & pack** ([`scripts`](scripts)) — esbuild-based backend/widget builds, static-file assembly into `dist/`, and a pure-Node ZIP writer producing `dist/sprint-capacity-planner.zip`.
- **Local-YouTrack harness** — no-Docker provision/seed/cleanup scripts with destructive + production-URL safety gates and run-id isolation, plus a self-skipping integration vitest suite.
- **Playwright E2E scaffolding** ([`tests/e2e`](tests/e2e)) — persona fixtures, critical/regression projects with the video/trace/screenshot capture policy, axe accessibility checks, and a video/contact-sheet integrity analyzer.
- **CI** ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) — fast lane (lint/typecheck/unit/contract/build/pack + package upload) and an opt-in, gated YouTrack lane.
- **Documentation** — [`README.md`](README.md), [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md), [`WORKFLOWS.md`](WORKFLOWS.md), [`DATA_MODEL.md`](DATA_MODEL.md), [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md), and [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
